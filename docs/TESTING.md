# Testing

Throne performs most business logic server side so main role of the model in this client application is to asynchronously keep data up to date with the server. Because of this, the vast majority of testing in this project is automated UI testing.

1. Follow the [Setup Documentation](SETUP.md) to get the application building and running.
2. Select the "Throne - Develop" build scheme on the top left.
2. Select the "iPhone 11" simulator on the top left.
8. Select `Product > Test` to build and test the app.
